        <p class="textContainerBlock darkPinkBack lightPinkColor"> What about TikTok, Reddit, Pinterest, or LinkedIn? Still not feeling called out yet? Well even though this website is mainly targeting personalization in social media, these sorts of recommendations are everywhere! Think about anytime a product is recommended on Amazon. Or when Google auto-fills your next search to be related to your previous searches. This is all AI similar to that being used in social media. So no matter who you are, you are impacted! Now let's learn more about the specifics of these impacts. </p>

            <h4 class="darkBlueColor"><u>Better Marketing Tactics</u></h4>
            <p class="darkBlueColor">As social media has grown in popularity, social media marketing has become a crucial part of business. Knowing how AI prioritizes ordering content allows businesses to utilize and play to the system. Businesses know what kind of advertisements to make: they can focus on trends and personalize their posts. By having a key target audience in mind, businesses can make their post, and let AI take it to the right customers. This ultimately leads to better, more focused content from advertisers and engagement from customers who are seeing the products and advertisements they like.

            <h4 class="darkBlueColor"><u>Better user experience</u></h4>
            <p class="darkBlueColor">Ever wonder why social media is so addicting and enjoyable? It's because the content you see is tailored to you! Of course your experience would be better if you're only getting recommended videos AI knows you'll like. And while users still have a diverse catalog of content available, they also don't have to go looking for content suited for them. It makes scrolling a mindless way to be happier. Better user experience is also a positive for the app itself. AI recommendations assure that users will be happier and spend more time interacting with the app.</p>

            <h4 class="darkBlueColor"><u>Social Media Addiction</u></h4>
            <p class="darkBlueColor">AI recommendations are almost too good at recommending content. Increased retention can easily turn into addiction. When all users see are funny, perfectly personalized videos, they get rushes of dopamine making them less inclined to stop scrolling and become stuck in a cycle. This becomes a problem when you consider how social media addiction impacts mental health. Studies have shown increased levels of depression, anxiety, irritability, body dysmorphia, and isolation. Although AI isn't the only cause of social media addiction, the addictive quality of personalized videos should be acknowledged when discussing AI in social media.

            <h4 class="darkBlueColor"><u>Echo Chambers / Filter Bubbles</u></h4>
            <p class="darkBlueColor"> Echo chambers are when the people in your environment have information and opinions that reflect your own. AI tends to only show you the information you've expressed interest in, from your perspective, meaning echo chambers are practically everywhere online. AI makes it easy to miss out on important information that can alter your viewpoint. These echo chambers, also known as filter bubbles, lead to a lack of understanding and the unwillingness to look at other opinions. This is even worse when you consider how people are more ostracized from one another because of apps that are meant to bring people together!</p>

      <h2 class="darkBlueColor" style="text-align:left;">Solutions?</h2>
      <p class="darkBlueColor solText">Sadly, there are no simple solutions to the problem. Both social media addiction and echo chambers are just consequences of AI doing its job too well. </p>
      <p class="darkBlueColor solText">It's hard to address solutions to social media addiction when the apps themselves were designed to be addictive. More time spent on the app means better business for the creators. However, developers of these addictive apps can take some steps to help lower the risk of addiction. For instance, recently TikTok added a feature where minors have a 60-minute screen time limit and a pop-up telling users they've reached the limit as well as an option to keep scrolling. While it's not really “limiting” the use, it keeps users aware of how much time they're spending on the app. Moves like this can at least be a break in the endless cycle of scrolling and lower rates of addiction.
      </p>
      <p class="darkBlueColor solText">
        It's risky to be dependent on the developers adding these features though, as they're counterintuitive to the developers' goals. When trying to prevent social media addiction, you need to be proactive and take steps yourself. Some tips can be setting screen time limits, limiting notifications, or replacing time spent on social media with a new hobby.
      </p>
      <p class="darkBlueColor solText">
        Similarly, the solutions to echo chambers are complex and dependent on user cooperation. The first step is being aware of echo chambers. Becoming more informed and learning to spot when you're in one is important. If you have Twitter, you can check how strong your echo chamber is on the <a id = "polLink"href="https://www.polarizationlab.com/echo-checker" target="_blank">polarization lab website!</a> It's also important to sign up for different resources. Don't just get information from one source, try to find several, then develop your opinion. Making sure you get a variety of different opinions means you're out of the echo chamber! And throughout this whole process, keep an open mind. We're so used to seeing our own opinions right back at us, it's hard to see another point of view, but trying to get out of the filter bubble is the first step towards becoming a  more well-informed, understanding person

      <p class="darkBlueColor solText">
        Overall, no solution will fix everything easily. The tips on this website are only the first steps, it's up to you to keep working towards fighting against the negative effects of AI in social media.
