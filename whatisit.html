      <p class="darkPinkBack textContainerBlock lightPinkColor">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is, put simply, a machine simulating human thinking and actions. AI systems are given large amounts of data which lets them look for patterns and make predictions. This makes AI extremely useful as it can perform repetitive, detail-oriented tasks quickly.</p>

      <h2 class="darkBlueColor">⭑ — Uses in Social Media — ⭑</h2>
      <p class="textContainerBlock darkBlueBack" style="color:#BDCAEC;">AI is used in social media in lots of ways, but I'm going to focus on its personalization. This means AI can choose what posts, videos, or ads to recommend based on previous data and personalize the content specifically for a user. The algorithm ranks content for each individual user based on a variety of factors: trends, previous interactions, following, or recency. All these determine which posts are sent to the top of a user's feed and which are never shown.</p>

        <h2 class="darkBlueColor">Still Confused?</h2>
        <p style="text-align:center;" class="darkBlueColor">Here's an example. Imagine recently you saw a post of a cute dog video. You watched the video all the way through and sent it to a friend. The next day, you see another one, and not only like the video but also follow the account. Soon your feed is flooded by dog posts. This isn't the work of magic, but AI! All those interactions told AI you like these types of posts and allowed it to make predictions on what content you'd like to see, in this case: dogs.</p>

        <h2 class="lightPinkColor" style="text-align:left;">Who Designs These AI?</h2>
        <p class="lightPinkColor">A lot of different people work on creating AI! One job that plays an integral role is a machine learning engineer. Machine learning engineers do a lot with AI, from researching and designing to actually building AI systems capable of making predictions. They develop the types of predictive algorithms used in social media!</p>
